# Common-Password-Generation

This is a password generation algorithm. This uses an English dictionary and generates passwords based off of mixing words and numbers.
Lengths of the password can be set as well.

The generation algorithm converts the plain-text to an MD5 hash and places them side by side: plaintext:hash
The generation is also very accurate and not just random combinations per character.
